# TimeSeriesForecasting_Hot_Water_Demand

The objective of this project is to forecast the volume of hot water drawn from a geyser using the sensor
measurements as the underlying data. Creating a robust model capable of accurately forecasting the
demand for hot water can be used to save electricity by drawing power during off-peak hours while
ensuring hot water is available when needed. The data used in this project is over a period of 4 months
from October 2020 to January 2021 inclusive. The data was preprocessed and relevant features were
generated, followed by exploratory data analysis, model selection and evaluation. Finally, the optimal
model was used to forecast the water volume drawn using the test dataset.

Improved accuracy of estimations by 88% when evaluating on the validation dataset using a hyperparameter tuned XGBoost model
