# TimeSeriesForecasting_Hot_Water_Demand
• Estimated volume of hot water drawn using readings of time-series temperature and energy sensor data from electric water heaters
• Built a data pipeline that performs aggregation, feature generation and transformation on sensor data to prepare modeling dataset
• Improved accuracy of estimations by 88% when evaluating on the validation dataset using a hyperparameter tuned XGBoost model
